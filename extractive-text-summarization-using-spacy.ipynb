Henry Arnold doing the stunt flying. \"Arnold, who picked up \\'a few extra bucks\\' for his services, became so excited about movies that he almost quit the Army to become an actor.\"[2]\\nThe years between World War I and World War II saw extensive use of the new technology, aircraft, in the new medium, film.[3] In the early 1920s Hollywood studios made dozens of now-obscure \"aerial Westerns\" with leads such as Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson, where the role of the horse was taken by aircraft, or used aircraft as nothing more than vehicles for stunts to excite audiences.[4] In 1926 the first \"proper\" aviation film was made; Wings is a story of two pilots who sign up to fly and fight in The Great War.[5] Made with the co-operation of the United States\\' then-Department of War (a relationship that continues to this day), it used front-line military aircraft of the day such as the Thomas-Morse MB-3 and Boeing PW-9, flown by military pilots.[6][7] Future US Air Force Generals Hap Arnold and Hoyt Vandenberg were among the military officers involved with the production, Arnold as a technical consultant and Vandenberg as one of the pilots.[8] Wings was a box-office hit when it achieved general release in 1929 and went on to win the award for Best Production at the first Academy Awards.[9][10]\\nIn Fascist Italy in the 1930s, aviation-themed films were used as propaganda tools to complement the massed flights led by Italo Balbo in promoting the regime domestically and abroad.[11] One such film was the most successful Italian film of the pre-World War II era; Luciano Serra pilota (Luciano Serra, Pilot) was inextricably linked to the Fascist government via Mussolini\\'s son Vittorio, who was the driving force behind the film\\'s production.[12] The film, set between 1921 and the Italo-Abyssinian War, was used to compare the allegedly moribund state of aviation in pre-Fascist Italy with the purported power of the Regia Aeronautica and Italian aviation in general in the 1930s.[13] However, by the time that Luciano Serra pilota was shown at the 1938 Venice Film Festival, the link between aviation and Fascism had already been firmly established in the minds of the Italian people through widespread depictions of aircraft in a variety of media.[12] For example, there was an entire branch of the Futurist Art movement devoted to aviation, known as Aeropittura (\"Aeropainting\").[14] While many of the Aeropittura works were devoted to flight rather than aircraft per se, some did celebrate Italian aviation exploits, such as Alfredo Ambrosi\\'s Il volo su Vienna (The Flight over Vienna) which depicted in Futurist style the World War I exploit of Gabriele d\\'Annunzio; although the city of Vienna is shown in abstract in accordance with the aims of Aeropittura – namely to show the dynamism and excitement of flight – the Ansaldo SVA aircraft are very carefully and accurately rendered.[14][15]\\n\\nIn the United States, the use or denial of use of current military aircraft in films is determined by the US military itself. The armed services review all requests for the use of aircraft, by examining the scripts to ensure that aircraft will only be used in films that show the US military in a positive light. Because alternatives to using real military aircraft can be expensive, films that do not get US military approval often do not get financed or made. Sean McElwee, writing for Salon.com, concluded of this problem,\"This is a prima facie case for de facto censorship\\xa0... If the government wants to allow its equipment to be used by studios, it needs to grant access to anyone who wants to use it – that is the meaning of pluralism. The Pentagon fears that some of the movies may hurt the military\\'s reputation and recruiting efforts. These concerns are legitimate, but it\\'s more important that we allow John Stuart Mill\\'s \\'market place of ideas\\' to be a place for free trade, rather than favoring some over others.\"[16]Since the advent of television, aircraft have been featured in numerous miniseries and series around the world. These include the American productions Twelve O\\'Clock High, Airwolf, Baa Baa Black Sheep, Sky King and Wings; the Australian series Big Sky, Chopper Squad and The Flying Doctors, and the miniseries The Lancaster Miller Affair; British shows such as Airline, Piece of Cake and Squadron, the Canadian series Arctic Air; JETS – Leben am Limit and Medicopter 117 – Jedes Leben zählt from Germany; and the Canadian–British–German co-production Ritter\\'s Cove.\\nIn the 1953 James A. Michener novel The Bridges at Toko-Ri, a number of Douglas AD-1 Skyraiders fly RESCAP missions over a downed McDonnell F2H Banshee and Sikorsky HO3S-1 during the Korean War. This is also the case in the 1954 film of the same name, but with the Banshee replaced by a Grumman F9F Panther.[17]\\nThe Skyraider was also featured as one of the many aircraft providing close air support during the First Battle of the Ia Drang Valley Campaign in Mel Gibson\\'s 2002 film We Were Soldiers,[18][19] based on the non-fiction book We Were Soldiers Once... And Young by Lieutenant General (Ret.) Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway.\\nThe 1986 Stephen Coonts novel Flight of the Intruder is about two naval aviators who take their Grumman A-6 Intruder on an unauthorized bombing raid on Hanoi during the Vietnam War. It was made into a 1991 film of the same name.[20]\\nThe popularity of the A-10 Thunderbolt II in the 2007 Transformers film led to the toy company releasing a minor character named Wingblade that turned into an A-10.[21][22]\\nThe A-10 is one of the player-flyable aircraft in the 1989 video game U.N. Squadron.[23] The aircraft is also featured in the 1989 video game A-10 Tank Killer.[24] Since then,[25] it has made appearances in the Ace Combat series. The A-10 has also been featured as a study level aircraft in the popular combat flight simulator DCS world.[26]\\nA-10s were also featured in the 2005 film Jarhead, where they attack U.S. Marine forces in a friendly fire incident.[27]\\nIn the 2009 film Terminator Salvation, several A-10s are sent to support the ground troops led by John Connor in the opening sequence of the film. Later, two Resistance A-10s are shot down when trying to intercept the machine transport in which Marcus Wright and Kyle Reese were captive.[28][29]\\nThree A-10s using the call sign \"Thunder\" are sent to Smallville to kill both Superman and General Zod and his henchmen in the 2013 film Man of Steel but are attacked by Zod\\'s forces, resulting in the destruction of two of the jets.[30]\\nTwo A-26s firebombers were prominently featured in the 1989 Steven Spielberg film, Always.[31] Attempts to use radio-controlled models for special effects shots were abandoned as unworkable and models \"flown\" from wire rigs were utilized instead.[32]\\nThe Mitsubishi A6M Zero was featured in the films The Final Countdown,[33] Pearl Harbor,[34][35] and Tora! Tora! Tora!.[36] The Zero was also depicted in the 1976 film Midway; however real Zeros were not used. Modified T-6 Texans were used in both Tora! Tora! Tora! and Midway to depict A6M2 Type 21 Zero fighters, and some footage from the former was reused in the latter.[37][38][39] Three Type 52 Zeros were used in Pearl Harbor. Two restored aircraft operated by Flight Magic, and one in the Planes of Fame Air Museum collection were barged to Hawaii where \"all three aircraft were extensively flown with few problems until NX6528L suffered a gear-up landing. Fortunately, this was near the end of filming. NX6528L was shipped to Pete Regina Aviation at Van Nuys, California where it was returned to flying condition. This aircraft is now with the Commemorative Air Force Southern California Wing at Camarillo Airport.\"[40][41]\\nThe A5M and A6M are both featured in The Wind Rises, a 2013 Studio Ghibli animated fictionalized biopic of Zero designer Jiro Horikoshi.[42]\\nZero fighters are a major feature in the 2013 Japanese novel Eien No Zero (The Eternal Zero) by Naoki Hyakuta. It was made into a 2013 film of the same name directed by Takashi Yamazaki.[43]\\nA heavily modified Aérospatiale Gazelle was the centerpiece of the 1983 John Badham action film Blue Thunder.[44] The same helicopter appeared in the short-lived 1984 TV series by the same name starring James Farentino. The modified Gazelle went on to be used in the TV mini-series Amerika.[45]\\nModified Aérospatiale SA 330 Pumas were used to depict Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships, in the films Red Dawn (1984), Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985), and Rambo III (1988).[46][47][48]\\nAt the climax of the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall, an armed AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin transport helicopter is used in the main villain Silva\\'s assault on Bond and M at Bond\\'s childhood home.[49][50][51]\\nThe Boeing AH-64 Apache had a major role in the 1990 action-thriller film directed by David Green, Fire Birds (or Wings of the Apache).[52]\\nThe 1992 shooter game Desert Strike has the main character flying the AH-64 to complete various missions.[53]\\nGunship is an AH-64 Apache helicopter simulation that was released by Microprose in 1986.[54] The sequel Gunship 2000 was released in 1991.[55]\\nAn AH-64 was used in an attempt to suppress the Hulk in the 2008 film, The Incredible Hulk. Although it has the standard, nose-mounted M230 Chain Gun, it instead attacks with the unusual configuration of twin, pylon-mounted miniguns.[56]\\nIn the 2009 film G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Apaches provide air cover for a convoy carrying nanotechnology-based weapons.[57]\\nThe assault on what would later be known as the Pegasus Bridge over the Caen Canal in France by British commandos landing in Airspeed Horsa gliders was depicted in the 1962 war epic The Longest Day. Only one Horsa replica was actually constructed.[58]\\nTen mockup Airspeed Horsa gliders were fabricated for the filming of the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far, but they were non-flyable.[59]\\nAn Albatros fighter appears in the 1966 novel In the Company of Eagles by Ernest K Gann. The novel is set in 1916 during the First World War and features a German ace pilot Lt Sebastian Kupper of Jasta 76 who, flying an Albatros scout, pursues a burning French aircraft and, in what was intended as an act of mercy, kills the pilot so as to spare him from slowly burning to death. The gesture is misinterpreted as an act of murder by one of the French pilot\\'s comrades, Sgt. Paul Chamay who vows to seek and kill the German pilot.[60]\\nAt least two American Eagle A-1s were employed in the production of the 1930 film Young Eagles which was directed by William A. Wellman and starred Buddy Rogers and Jean Arthur. The film portrayed American pilots serving in France during the Great War. Although the A-1 was a post-WW1 trainer, the film-makers considered it suitable to portray wartime aircraft. One Eagle was painted with USAS insignia while a second was painted with German markings. Stunt pilot Dick Grace was hired to deliberately crash-land both of them in separate scenes, which severely damaged both aircraft. Grace escaped injury on both occasions.[61]\\nAn Avro Anson was used as a \"stand-in\" to represent the Boeing 247 Race 57 flown in the 1934 England-to-Australia MacRobertson Air Race by Roscoe Turner, in the 1991 Australian television miniseries The Great Air Race.[62] Turner was played by Barry Bostwick in the miniseries.\\nAn Avro Ashton, in its six-engined, Olympus testbed form, appeared as the fictitious Phoenix airliner in Cone of Silence (1960), based on the novel of the same name[63] by David Beaty, a former BOAC pilot. This concerned the takeoff problems of the Phoenix, and the subsequent accident investigation; it was based on two takeoff accidents to the de Havilland Comet.[64]\\nThe Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow makes a prominent appearance in Daniel Wyatt\\'s 1990 novel, The Last Flight of the Arrow. In the novel, the real-life destruction of the fighter is a cover for a secret US-Canadian continental air-defense initiative that fields a fleet of Arrows. A Polish-Canadian Royal Canadian Air Force pilot flies one Arrow on a high-speed reconnaissance flight over Russia to find proof that the Soviet Union is planning an airstrike on North America.[65]\\nThe Avro Lancaster was perhaps the most well-known and successful Royal Air Force heavy bomber of World War II.[66] As such it has appeared in many works of fiction related to Bomber Command and its night raids over Germany and occupied Europe.\\nLancasters appeared in the 1952 British war film Appointment in London (released in the US as Raiders in the Sky) directed by Philip Leacock and starring Dirk Bogarde.[67] Three Lancasters were used in the production—NX673, NX679 and NX782, the same three that were used in the filming of The Dam Busters three years later.[68]\\nThe Lancaster was central to the second half of the 1955 British film The Dam Busters. This is a dramatisation of the real-life Operation Chastise, which included the forming of No. 617 Squadron RAF commanded by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, who was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), and the bombing of the Möhne, Eder and Sorpe Dams in Germany to interrupt water and hydro-electric power supplies to German munitions factories.[69] The film is based on the books The Dam Busters by Paul Brickhill and Enemy Coast Ahead by Guy Gibson. A number of B VII Lancasters in storage were modified to the original configuration of the B III (Special) for use on screen.[70]\\nThe Lancaster also appeared in The Guns of Navarone (1961).[71]\\nA 1989 British commercial for Carling Black Label lager reused Avro Lancaster footage in a Dam Busters parody sequence where a German soldier on top of a dam catches the Lancaster\\'s bombs like a football goalkeeper. The pilot of the attacking Lancaster then delivers the brand slogan: \"I bet he drinks Carling Black Label!\" The commercial ran for many years, frequently appearing in commercial breaks during broadcasts of both The Dam Busters and documentaries about Operation Chastise.[72]\\nLen Deighton\\'s 1970 novel Bomber describes an attack by Royal Air Force Lancasters on Krefeld, Germany, during which a series of unplanned incidents leads to the carpet bombing of a small town nearby.[73]\\nThe Avro Lancaster was also featured in the UK television series Pathfinders, aired in 1972, concentrating on the lives of the aircrew of a fictional Pathfinder squadron during the Second World War.[74]\\nLancasters feature in the 2011 novel Dambuster by Robert Radcliffe.[75]\\nThe 2019 budget independent film Lancaster Skies (also titled Our Shining Sword) centres on a loner who takes over as leader of a Lancaster crew.[76]\\nThe Avro Lancaster was the preferred aircraft of the fictional war hero pilot Matt Braddock, who first appeared in the British story paper The Rover,[77][non-primary source needed] and later in comic strips in British action comics The Victor and Warlord.[78]\\nAvro Vulcans are the central feature of the 2008 aviation novel by English author Derek Robinson, titled Hullo Russia, Goodbye England. A British RAF pilot named Silk, a veteran of Bomber Command in the Second World War, rejoins the service at the height of the Cold War.[79]\\nThe 1965 James Bond film Thunderball features the hijacking of an Avro Vulcan.[80]\\nA B-1B Lancer was portrayed as the laser weapon\\'s test bed in the closing scenes of the 1985 film Real Genius.[81]\\nA B-1B Lancer drops numerous bombs during the climactic battle scene in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.[82]\\nThe Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit is featured in the 1996 Independence Day film, where it fires a nuclear missile at an antagonist alien spaceship.[83] In the movie Cloverfield, the aircraft bombs a monster that is destroying Manhattan. The bomber also made appearances in films Iron Man 2, Captain Marvel, and Rampage.[84]\\nBoeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the 132nd Bomb Squadron, 9th Bomb Group from March Field, California, (\"Land of the Flying Fortress\") were featured in the 1941 Paramount Pictures film I Wanted Wings, based on the novel of the same title by 1st Lt. Beirne Lay Jr.[17]\\nIn William Wyler\\'s 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives, B-17s are prominently featured. The primary male characters hitch a cross country ride in a B-17E Flying Fortress early in the story, and at the conclusion the scrapyard at Chino, California, is shown full of disposal B-17s and YB-40 gunship versions of the B-17.[85]\\nB-17s also figured prominently in the Oscar-winning 1949 film Twelve O\\'Clock High starring Gregory Peck. The film concerns aviation leadership and the human toll in the USAAF strategy of daylight precision bombing.[86] The US Air Force cooperated in the production of the film, lending aircraft to the producers and allowing filming at Eglin Air Force Base and at Ozark Army Air Field.[87] The film featured an actual crash landing of a B-17, piloted by veteran stunt pilot Paul Mantz.[88]\\nB-17s feature in the 1951 novel The Sun is Silent by Saul Levitt which traces the journey of a B-17 crew from their training through to daylight bombing missions over Germany. The author himself had served as a radioman/gunner in a B-17 during the war.[89]\\nFor the 1954 film The Glenn Miller Story, directed by Anthony Mann, a wartime performance set in a UK air base hangar was shot in Hangar No. 1 at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, on 10 July 1953, with the late-production B-17G command aircraft of Gen. John G. Sprague, commanding officer of Lowry, as a backdrop. It received a wartime coat of olive drab paint for the appearance, but the chin turret was removed. Anachronistic B-29 engine cowlings line the back wall of the hangar, although B-29s were not used in the ETO.[90][91]\\nFive flyable B-17s were secured by producer Elmo Williams for use in the filming of the 1970 motion picture Tora! Tora! Tora!. During filming, one B-17 suffered a landing gear malfunction, forcing it to land on one wheel. Williams ordered a camera crew to film the landing and incorporated the footage into the film\\'s script.[92]\\nThe B-17 Flying Fortress was the subject of the 1990 Warner Bros. film Memphis Belle.[93] During filming, one of the five vintage B-17s was destroyed in an accidental crash and a second was damaged when an engine cowling detached in flight, tearing a chunk out of the aircraft\\'s tail. There were no injuries in either incident.[94]\\nB-17s are the main aircraft featured in two novels depicting fictional characters in the US daylight bombing offensive over Germany and Occupied Europe, American writer Sam Helpert\\'s A Real Good War (1997)[95] and UK author Robert Radcliffe\\'s Under an English Heaven (2004).[96]\\nFor George Lucas\\' 2012 film Red Tails about the 332d Fighter Group, the Tuskegee Airmen, the B-17G \"Pink Lady\" operated by the Association Forteresse Toujours Volante, appeared as a 351st Bomb Group aircraft named \"Yankee\", coded ED-N. Filmed in the Czech Republic in 2010, the film company funding allowed the warbird to fly for an additional year before being retired to museum status. Other Flying Fortresses were rendered through CGI.[97]\\nB-17s feature in the 2014 graphic novel mini-series Castles in the Sky, published by Avatar, written by Garth Ennis and illustrated by Matt Martin & Keith Burns. The story features a gunner named Leonard Wetmore who is one of the crew of the B-17 \\'Buffalo Gal\\' during the US daylight bombing offensive against Germany. The story was one of Ennis\\' War Stories series.[98]\\nDouglas B-18 Bolos are prominently featured in the 1943 RKO picture Bombardier, filmed at Kirtland Field, New Mexico.[99]\\nA Consolidated B-24 Liberator was featured in the 1977 Telemovie Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy.[100]\\nB-24s feature in the 1944 20th Century Fox film Winged Victory which was directed by George Cukor and which portrayed cadets undergoing training as aircrew in the USAF during WW2. The USAF loaned several B-24s to the production which was filmed at Santa Ana army airfield in California.[101]\\nThe novel Face of a Hero (1950) tells the story of a B-24 crew operating from an airport in Apulia, Italy, in 1944; it is based on the real experiences of its author, Louis Falstein, who had been a tail gunner on a USAAF B-24. The novel describes in detail the raids of the B-24 bombers on Romania, Yugoslavia, northern Italy, southern France, and Germany.[102]\\nB-24s are a central feature in the 1952 novel Angle of Attack by Joseph Landon. The story concerns navigator Irwin \\'Win\\' Hellman, whose B-24 is attacked by enemy fighters and badly damaged over Vienna. The B-24\\'s pilot signals to the enemy fliers that he wishes to surrender but Hellman, who is Jewish and dreads being captured alive, believes they can still escape and, with the backing of the other crew, he takes command.[103]\\nB-24s also feature in the 1957 novel The Damned Wear Wings by David Camerer, a work that portrays B-24s of the 473rd Bomb Group based in Italy tasked with bombing the oil refineries at Ploesti, Romania.[104]\\nThe 1961 novel Goodbye to Some by Gordon Forbes portrays Lt Carl Iverson, a pilot of a B-24 of VPB-400 US Navy Air Wing, a unit that flies patrols from a base in the Sulu Sea during the Pacific War in WW2.[105]\\nThe story of the \"Lady Be Good\" inspired a 1970 television movie titled Sole Survivor, with a North American B-25 Mitchell playing the B-24D role.[106]\\nIn the young adult novel Under a War-Torn Sky, the main character Henry Forester co-pilots Out of the Blue, a US B-24 Liberator serving in the Royal Air Force.[107]\\nB-24s feature in the 1979 novel The White Sea Bird by David Beaty, a story about an RAF bomber unit whose commander becomes obsessed with hunting a German surface raider lurking in a secret base in a Norwegian Fjord and menacing Allied convoys at sea.[108]\\nB-24s are a major feature of the 1979 novel Rider on the Wind by David Westheimer. The novel portrays a B-24 pilot of the USAAF stationed in Palestine during the Second World War and who meets a Jewish resistance-fighter. The author himself served as a navigator in a B-24 with the 98th Bomb Group stationed in Palestine & Egypt in 1942.[109]\\nThe North American B-25 Mitchell had feature roles in the films Thirty Seconds over Tokyo (1944) (pilot Ted Lawson\\'s account of the Doolittle Raid[110]), Hanover Street (1979) based on a fictional B-25 unit stationed in England,[110] and Forever Young (1992), following a B-25 test pilot\\'s story both in the past and present.[111]\\nA B-25 features in the 1965 World War II film In Harm\\'s Way directed by Otto Preminger and starring John Wayne and Kirk Douglas.[112]\\nThe Sole Survivor, a 1970 telemovie, was also based loosely on the \"Lady Be Good\", and also featured a B-25 in the Liberator role. It first aired 9 January 1970.[113]\\nThe B-25 is featured in the 1970 Mike Nichols film Catch-22, which had 17 film unit B-25s in flying condition.[114] Like the Battle of Britain\\'s resurrection and ultimate preservation of German and British aviation combatants, the Catch-22 air force helped form a nucleus of the nascent warbirds movement. Fifteen of the 18 bombers used in the film still remain intact, including one on display at the Smithsonian Institution\\'s National Air and Space Museum.[115]\\nB-25s feature in the 1976 novel Whip by Martin Caidin, which portrays a B-25 unit based in Australia and commanded by Captain \\'Whip\\' Russell and they are employed in low-level bombing missions against Japanese convoys carrying reinforcements to Guadalcanal and Rabaul in 1942.[116][117]\\nThe B-25 was the focus of the second half of the 2001 film Pearl Harbor, although critics complained that the bomber and its role were being depicted inaccurately.[118]\\nThe bulk of the action in Craig Johnson\\'s 2013 novel Spirit of Steamboat takes place on an old Mitchel VB-25J nicknamed \"Steamboat\", as it is flown through a snowstorm on a rescue mission over the Great Plains.[119]\\nA B-25 is used in the 2011 film Sucker Punch.[120]\\nB-25s appear in the 2019 Hulu mini-series Catch-22 directed by George Clooney.[121] Two vintage B-25s were used in the production[122] and other B-25s were re-created with CGI.[123]\\nThe Boeing B-29 Superfortress has played an important role in several Hollywood films, particularly the Enola Gay, which dropped the first atomic bomb. The Enola Gay was depicted in Above and Beyond and The Beginning or the End.[124]\\nThe first Hollywood retelling of the 509th Composite Group\\'s preparation for the atomic missions was Above and Beyond, released by MGM in 1953, with Robert Taylor portraying Col. Paul Tibbetts, and Jim Backus as Gen. Curtis LeMay. Filmed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.[125]\\nThe B-29 also played the titular role in the 1980 Disney film The Last Flight of Noah\\'s Ark.[126]\\nFilm makers also used the only B-29 still flying in 1983 in the film The Right Stuff to recreate the launch of the Bell X-1 for the first supersonic flight.[127]\\nThe Convair B-36 featured prominently in Paramount\\'s 1955 film Strategic Air Command starring James Stewart, who plays a World War II bomber pilot and member of the Air Force Reserve and is forced to crash land in the Arctic. The film features many good aerial shots of B-36s and was primarily filmed at Carswell AFB, Texas, and MacDill AFB in Tampa, Florida, and Al Lang Field in nearby St. Petersburg, Florida. One particularly difficult shot was that of Stewart\\'s character, a baseball player, standing on the baseball field at Al Lang Field while a B-36 flies overhead and casts a shadow over him, foreshadowing his imminent recall to active service.[128]\\nThe Boeing B-47 Stratojet gets a secondary role in Paramount\\'s 1955 film Strategic Air Command (SAC), starring James Stewart, as the new jet that is nothing like the old Convair B-36 he is used to.[129] The film features good aerial footage of both the B-47 and the B-36. The majority of B-47 scenes were filmed at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, using aircraft from the 306th Bombardment Wing.[130]\\nEjection seat testing of B-47s performed at Eglin AFB, Florida, in 1953 and 1954 as part of aeromedical research was recreated in the 1955 20th Century Fox film On the Threshold of Space starring Guy Madison,[131][132] and in a 1957 Pine-Thomas Productions drama Bailout at 43,000.[133]\\nThe 1957 Warner Brothers melodrama film Bombers B-52 features Castle Air Force Base, proudly sporting its slogan \"Home of the B-47\", and its transition from the Stratojet to the new B-52.[134][135][136]\\nThe 1963 film A Gathering of Eagles focuses on the stresses of a B-52 wing commander at the height of the Cold War. Some excellent visuals of the B-52 including a complex inflight refueling operation which nearly ends in disaster.[137]\\nThe B-52 was also a key part of Stanley Kubrick\\'s 1964 black comedy film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.[138]\\nA B-52 was a focal point of the 1983 novel Trinity\\'s Child, by William Prochnau, and the 1990 telemovie adaptation, By Dawn\\'s Early Light.[139]\\nThe 1950s syndicated American television series Whirlybirds, produced by Desilu Studios, starred a pair of Bell 47 helicopters. The association with Whirlybirds continues to be used to promote helicopters and the Bell 47 in particular.[140] A Bell 47 was also one of the \\'stars\\' of the Australian television series Skippy the Bush Kangaroo.[141]\\nIn the opening scenes of Federico Fellini\\'s 1960 comedy-drama film La Dolce Vita a Bell 47 transports a statue of Christ across the city of Rome. A second Bell 47 in pursuit contains the reporter Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni) and his sidekick Papparazo.[142]\\nA Bell 47J equipped with floats was used in the 1965 James Bond film Thunderball. The helicopter lands on the water as Bond searches for an Avro Vulcan bomber that has gone missing.[143]\\nA Bell 47G3B-1 was used as the \"Batcopter\" in the 1966 Batman film. This airframe had previously appeared in Lassie Come Home.[144]\\nA Bell 47 depicted a supposed German helicopter in the 1968 action film Where Eagles Dare. Although experimental German helicopter types did exist in this time period, the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 was a larger, twin-rotor machine, which was used on only a limited basis.[145][146]\\nThe Bell 47, in its military configuration as a H-13 Sioux regularly appeared in the M*A*S*H film (1970) and television series (1972-1983).[147]\\nIn the 1979 Norman Jewison film ...And Justice For All, the main characters go for a ride in a Bell 47G-2 that ends up ditching in Baltimore\\'s Inner Harbor when it runs out of fuel.[148]\\nChopper Squad was a 1970s Australian television series about a Bell 206 JetRanger used for rescue work in Sydney. The helicopter used was an actual rescue helicopter operated by the Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service.[141]\\nA Bell 206B was one of the helicopters that attacks the oil rig control center of Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the climactic scenes of the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever.[149] The Jet Ranger also appeared in the 1977 Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me[150]\\nIn the 1983 film Blue Thunder, a Jet Ranger is portrayed as a LAPD helicopter flying for the Astro division.[45] Also appears in the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, as another LAPD helicopter, which is stolen by the T-1000 Terminator and flown under an expressway to pursue John Connor, Sarah Connor and the T-800 Terminator protecting them.[151]\\nA Bell 222A was featured in the telemovie Airwolf, which starred Jan-Michael Vincent and Ernest Borgnine. Within the year, the film was made into a TV series which aired from 1984 to 1986.[152]\\nIn the 1991 film Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man, a Bell 222UT is used to eliminate the antagonists in a high rise building near downtown Los Angeles.[153]\\nIn the 1990 film Fire Birds, a Bell AH-1 Cobra of the United States Army emerges in the opening sequence, when it is ambushed by a drug runner\\'s Scorpion helicopter portrayed by a McDonnell Douglas MD 500 Defender.[52]\\nA pair of AH-1s appear in Simon West\\'s 1997 film Con Air.

The film makes use of genuine, airworthy aircraft, rather than models, for many of the scenes.[273]\\nMosquitos also play the title role of the 1969 film Mosquito Squadron, starring David McCallum and Charles Gray.[274]\\nThe Mosquito plays an important role with the de Havilland Vampire in Frederick Forsyth\\'s 1975 novella The Shepherd.[275]\\nScott Summers and his younger brother Alex Summers, members of Marvel Comics\\' X-Men, are orphaned as children after parachuting out of their father\\'s Mosquito when it is set ablaze by an alien attack.[276]\\nMosquitos play a central role in the 2019 graphic novel Out of the Blue written by Garth Ennis and illustrated by Keith Burns. The story features a young pilot Jamie Mckenzie who joins a Mosquito fighter-bomber unit of the Royal Air-Force and clashes with his CO.[277]\\nA de Havilland Leopard Moth was painted as de Havilland DH.80 Puss Moth, VH-UQO, \"My Hildegarde\", race number 16, for the 1991 Australian mini-series The Great Air Race, about the 1934 London to Melbourne MacRobertson Air Race.[266] It is also known as Half a World Away.[265]\\nA de Havilland DH.82 Tiger Moth appears in the 1952 David Lean film The Sound Barrier. In the film, Christopher Ridgefield (Denholm Elliott) is killed in a crash while nervously trying to fly his first solo in a Tiger Moth to meet the approval of his stern father Sir John (Ralph Richardson).[278][279]\\nA Tiger Moth appears in the opening scene of the 1996 film The English Patient, flying over the Sahara Desert, carrying a man and a woman. The aircraft is shot down in flames, leaving the pilot with horrific burns. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Michael Ondaatje.[280]\\nA Tiger Moth, G-ANFM, piloted by former ATA pilot Joan Hughes MBE appears in the 1968 film Thunderbird 6. During filming, the aircraft was flown under a motorway bridge over the M40 near High Wycombe, resulting in the prosecution of Hughes and the Production Director, Norman Foster.[281]\\nde Havilland Vampires feature in the 1954 British motion picture Conflict of Wings, a drama about the conflict that arises when an RAF squadron based in Norfolk is allocated a small island to use as a range for low-level attack training only to encounter the protests of nearby villagers who want the island preserved as a bird sanctuary.[282]\\nVampires also feature in the 1966 novel Shooting Script by former RAF pilot and thriller writer Gavin Lyall.[283]\\nThe Vampire is central to the plot of the 1975 novella, The Shepherd by British novelist Frederick Forsyth, the story of an RAF pilot attempting to fly home for Christmas from RAF Celle, Germany, to RAF Lakenheath on Christmas Eve 1957. The fact that the DH.100 was not fitted with ejection seats until about ten years later, and hence was a major challenge to bail out of, is an important element of the story.[284][285]\\nDouglas DC-2, PH-AJU, \"Uiver\", race number 44, was depicted by Douglas DC-3, VH-ANR, in the 1991 Australian mini-series The Great Air Race, about the 1934 London to Melbourne MacRobertson Trophy Air Race.[266] It is also known as Half a World Away.[265]\\nA Douglas DC-3A of Central Airlines appears in the 1954 film Strategic Air Command as the transport that conveys a security check team into Carswell AFB, Texas.[286]\\nThe 1961 episode of The Twilight Zone entitled \"The Arrival\" features a DC-3 on Flight 107, which arrives at its destination with no one on board. It originally aired 22 September 1961.[287]\\nThe chief character of the 1965 novel High Citadel by Desmond Bagley is an alcoholic former Korean War fighter pilot who flies a Douglas DC-3 for a small airline in a fictional Andean country in South America. He is forced at gunpoint by his co-pilot—a Communist agent—to crash-land the DC-3 at a remote abandoned mine in the Andes so that Communists planning a coup can capture and kill a politician travelling as a passenger.[288]\\nA DC-3 starred in the 1982 British television series Airline. The aircraft used to depict the DC-3 of the fictional Ruskin Air Services was also used in the 1980s television series Tenko and the 2001 series Band of Brothers.[289][290]\\nIn the 1985 two-part episode of the television series Magnum, P.I. entitled \"All For One\", the four main characters (Thomas, Rick, T.C. and Higgins) fly from Hawai\\'i to Cambodia in a DC-3 (c/n N162E) to carry out a personal mission. Several scenes are filmed both inside and outside of this aircraft.[291]\\nIn the 1989 comedy film Major League, the hard-luck Cleveland Indians baseball team is \"upgraded\" to a DC-3 for their transportation to away games.[292]\\nIn the 1994 film Richie Rich, the Rich family own and pilot a DC-3, named \"Billion Dollar One\", which crashes in the Atlantic due to a bomb on board.[293]\\nThe DC-3 features in a chase scene in the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace.[294]\\nThe 2012 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television series Arctic Air features a Yellowknife-based airline that relies on DC-3s.[295]\\nThe 2016 film Rules Don\\'t Apply features a DC-3 in two sequences on land and one in air. Howard Hughes pilots the DC-3 in a risky manner while two other passengers are aboard, shutting off the engines in-air and performing a \"proper glide\".[296]\\nThe Douglas DC-4 appears in the Ernest K. Gann novel The High and the Mighty. A former USAF Douglas C-54 Skymaster operated by Transocean Airlines portrayed the Douglas DC-4 in the John Wayne 1954 film of the same name.[297] Ironically, this airframe was lost over the Pacific on 28 March 1964 with an engine fire just as depicted in the film. There were no survivors of the nine \"souls on board\" and the wreckage was never found.[298]\\nIn the 1990 action film Die Hard 2, a Douglas DC-8 is given false landing instructions by terrorists and crash lands in a blizzard, resulting in fatalities to all on board. Industrial Light and Magic used a 23-foot long model to shoot the effects of the crash and explosion. Filming was done at a remote airstrip in the Mojave Desert of California. \"However, shots of the passengers\\' frightened reactions to the initial impact, which had been shot on a set and originally cut into the movie, were so terrifying (made all the more authentic by preproduction research of Federal Aviation Administration test crashes and data from real aircraft crashes) that they were ultimately cut before the film\\'s release.\" ILM constructed five DC-8 models for the production.[182]\\nThe film Bat*21 featured an EB-66 variant of the Douglas B-66 Destroyer[299] being shot down over North Vietnam in the beginning of the film.\\nThe 1976 children\\'s book Thunder and Lightnings by Jan Mark is about the relationship of two boys – otherwise outsiders – who share an interest in aeroplanes, in particular the English Electric Lightnings flown by the local squadron. The author was awarded the Carnegie Medal in 1978 for the book.[300][301]\\nA Eurocopter EC665 Tiger attack helicopter has a starring role in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye.[302]\\nThree Eurocopter EC665 Tigers save the day in the 2017 film Rescue Under Fire.[243]\\nA Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma becomes the main protagonist of the film Rescue under fire. The unit used for filming in the movie was the same as in the real events.[243]\\nProtagonist Lt. Harry Brubaker flew a McDonnell F2H Banshee in the 1953 James A. Michener novel The Bridges at Toko-Ri. In the subsequent 1954 film adaptation, his aircraft was changed to a Grumman F9F Panther.[303]\\nFlight Command, released by MGM in 1940, featured the Grumman F3F, filmed at NAS North Island, San Diego, California. Flying by Frank Clarke and Paul Mantz.[217]\\nThe 1941 Warner Bros. film Dive Bomber showed Grumman F3Fs.[304] F3F-2, BuNo 0989, \\'6-F-4\\', of VF-6, assigned to USS\\xa0Enterprise, is one of the best-known F3F-2\\'s due to the fact it is the aircraft that Fred MacMurray \"crashed\" in this movie.[305] Filming began at NAS North Island, San Diego, California, on 20 March 1941.[306]\\nUS Marine aviator Lt. Col. Wilbur \"Bull\" Meecham flew an F-4 Phantom II in the 1979 film The Great Santini starring Robert Duvall as Meecham.[307]\\nThe Gobots character Mach 3 and the Transformers character Fireflight both turn into McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs.[248]\\nIn the 1988 film Iron Eagle II, F-4s appear as Soviet MiGs. The aircraft were provided by the Israeli Air Force for the production.[308]\\nGrumman F4F Wildcats were shown in the critical aerial battle scenes in the film Midway.[309]\\nVought F4U Corsairs featured in the latter part of the 1951 RKO war movie Flying Leathernecks which was directed by Nicholas Ray and starred John Wayne and Robert Ryan. The film\\'s fictional Marine Air Corps unit exchange their older fighters for new F4Us as they support the drive across the Pacific in the latter stages of the war. For the film, the producers borrowed a number of flying F4Us which were then serving as trainers at the Marine Air Base at El Toro, California, and they also incorporated some wartime colour footage of F4Us taken during WW2.[310]\\nF4Us also featured in the 1952 Monogram film Flat Top which was directed by Lesley Selander and starred Sterling Hayden. In the film, Hayden plays Commander Dan Collier who takes command of a squadron of un-disciplined fighter pilots on board an aircraft carrier and is tasked with getting them combat-ready before the invasion of the Japanese-occupied Philippines in 1944. The film made extensive use of colour wartime footage of carrier-borne F4Us.[311]\\nThe F4U Corsair was a regularly featured aircraft of VMF-214 in the 1976–1978 television series Baa Baa Black Sheep, based on the experiences of Pappy Boyington. The series was later renamed Black Sheep Squadron.[312]\\nComputer-generated images of F4U Corsairs appear in the 2006 Second World War drama Flags of Our Fathers directed by Clint Eastwood.[313]\\nAn F4U Corsair named Skipper Riley (voiced by Stacy Keach) is one of the characters in Disney\\'s animated TV series and films \"Air Mater\" (2011), Planes (2013).[314]\\nNorthrop F-5s played the part of the fictional MiG-28 enemy aircraft in the 1986 film Top Gun.[315][316]\\nThe sole Grumman XF5F-1 Skyrocket, which never entered production or squadron service, was incorporated as the primary mount for Blackhawk and the Blackhawk Squadron in wartime editions of the anthology series Military Comics published by Quality Comics, the first issue of which was published in August 1941. The long-running title was later acquired by DC Comics, with the squadron upgrading to more modern types.[317]\\nGrumman F6F Hellcats appeared in the 1951 motion picture Flying Leathernecks directed by Nicholas Ray and starring John Wayne.[318] One of the pilots who flew aircraft for the aerial scenes in the production was Marine Captain Phil De Groot who, after completing work on the film, flew in the Korean War and was wounded in action. The production was filmed at a small airstrip at Camp Pendleton, California. De Groot said, \"They put some sand all over the strip, and some palm trees, and built a little pagoda there, simulating Guadalcanal\".[319]\\nF6Fs appear in the 1964 novel The Last Tallyho by Richard Newhafer, a work inspired by the author\\'s real-life experiences as a Hellcat pilot during WW2.[320]\\nF6Fs also feature in the 1978 novel Wingmen by Ensan Case, a novel depicting US Navy fighter pilots serving on a fictional aircraft carrier- the \\'USS Constitution\\'. The carrier\\'s fighter squadron- VF-20- takes part in the Pacific War 1943-1944 and it centres on the experiences of two of its members- ensign Fred Trusteau and the squadron-commander, Lt Jack Hardigan.[321]\\nComputer-generated images of F6F Hellcats appear in the 2002 Second World War drama Windtalkers directed by John Woo and starring Nicolas Cage.[322]\\nThe Grumman F9F-2 Panther was prominently featured in the 1954 films Men of the Fighting Lady and The Bridges at Toko-Ri, although the protagonist instead flew a McDonnell F2H Banshee in the 1953 novel of the same name on which the latter film was based.[303] Footage of the famous non-fatal F9F-5 Panther ramp strike accident that occurred on 23 June 1951 as Commander George Chamberlain Duncan attempted to land on USS\\xa0Midway in BuNo 125228, in which the forward fuselage broke away and rolled down the deck, has been used in several films including Men of the Fighting Lady, Midway (1976), and The Hunt For Red October (1990).[323]\\nThe Grumman F-14 Tomcat was central to the 1986 film Top Gun.[33][324][325] The aviation-themed film was such a success in creating interest in naval aviation that the US Navy, which assisted with the film, set up recruitment desks outside some theaters.[326] Producers paid the US Navy $886,000 as reimbursement for flight time of aircraft in the film with an F-14 billed at $7,600 per flight hour.[327][316]\\nTwo F-14As of VF-84 from the USS\\xa0Nimitz appeared in the 1980 film The Final Countdown,[328] with four from the squadron in the 1996 release Executive Decision,[329] the Jolly Rogers\\' final film appearance before being disestablished. The military legal drama TV series JAG (1995–2005) featured lead character Harmon Rabb, a Tomcat pilot-turned-lawyer,[33] and the Tomcat was a central part of the Stephen Coonts novel Final Flight.[33]\\nThe F-14 Tomcat is the primary focus of the 1987 Williams pinball machine \"F-14 Tomcat\",[330] and the After Burner video game series by Sega.[331]\\nThe McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is one of the most recognized modern fighters; this has led to, or perhaps even been aided by, its common use in children\\'s toys. Leader-1 of the Gobots turns into an F-15.[332] The Transformers toy line and media have featured numerous characters who turn into F-15 Eagles, the most notable being the villain Starscream in 1984[333] and a group of similar Decepticons, the Seekers: Acid Storm, Thundercracker, Skywarp and Sunstorm. Although a completely unrelated design to the others, the Aerialbot Air Raid also disguises himself as an F-15.[334]\\nF-15s feature in the 1980 novel Eagles by M H Davis, a work which portrays pilots of the USAF.[335]\\nThe F-15 is featured in the 1997 film Air Force One.[184] The Eagle was also shown in advertisements for the 2000 film Thirteen Days. The ads were withdrawn when it came to the attention of New Line Cinema that the F-15, which first flew in 1972, was out of place for a film set in 1962. This was problematic for New Line, who had termed the film a \"by-the-numbers recreation\" and \"close to perfect\". A New Line spokesman said the advertisement was created by an outside agency.[336]\\nF-15Js and F-15DJs appear prominently in the 2004 film Ultraman: The Next. The film\\'s protagonist, Shunichi Maki, is a prestigious pilot of the F-15, and encounters the enigmatic Ultraman \\'The Next\\' while flying the aircraft.[337]\\nThe F-15 has appeared in numerous video games, including the 1985 Microprose title F-15 Strike Eagle[338] and its two sequels, 1989\\'s F-15 Strike Eagle II[339] and 1992\\'s F-15 Strike Eagle III.[340]\\nA number of video games have featured the F-16: the Falcon series (1984-2005), F-16 Combat Pilot (1989), F-16 Multirole Fighter (1998), F-16 Aggressor (1999) and many others.[341]\\nThe Transformers Aerialbot Skydive and Decepticon Dreadwind disguise themselves as F-16 Fighting Falcons.[342] The Transformers character Needlenose disguises himself as an F-16XL.[343]\\nThe Falcon was one of the stars of the 1986 film Iron Eagle. The US Air Force refused to assist with production of the film because it found the plot about a teenager flying an F-16 into a foreign country to be \"a little off the wall\".[327]\\nThe 1986 action-adventure romantic comedy film The Jewel of the Nile featured a brutal dictator\\'s personal F-16 as the key element in the protagonists (played by Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas) escaping from a fortified town.[344]\\nThe aircraft was also featured in the HBO 1992 production Afterburn. A dramatization of true events, the F-16 was the subject of a protracted legal battle over the safety of the design.[345]\\nThe F-16 was featured in the 2002 film The Sum of All Fears.[185]\\nStarting in 2007, the F-16 became one of two aircraft (along with the Cirrus SR22) to be featured in Google Earth Flight Simulator.[346]\\nThe McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet appears in the 1994 film Clear and Present Danger which was directed by Phillip Noyce. The jet drops a laser-guided bomb on a car at a drug lord\\'s villa, being laser designated by a special forces team.[347]\\nIn the 1996 Michael Bay-directed film The Rock, F/A-18s attack the prison on Alcatraz Island in the final scenes.[348]\\nThe F/A-18 Hornet was prominently featured in the 1996 film Independence Day and was filmed using F/A-18 squadrons belonging to the 3rd Marine Corps Aircraft Wing at El Toro and Miramar, in California.[347]\\nF/A-18s successfully attack the famous Japanese monster Godzilla (ゴジラ |Gojira) with AGM-84 Harpoons in the 1998 remake film Godzilla.[347]\\nThe updated two-seater F/A-18F Super Hornet variant was featured in the 2001 film Behind Enemy Lines, directed by John Moore, and starring Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman. The plot begins with a Super Hornet being shot down over Bosnia.[349]\\nThe F/A-18 Hornet appeared briefly in the 2003 film Tears of the Sun in the final, climactic battle, helping to save the surviving SEAL team members.[350]\\nIn the 2013 Disney animated film Planes, the characters Bravo and Echo are based on the F/A-18E Super Hornet.[351]\\nThe F/A-18 Super Hornet is to be featured in the upcoming film, Top Gun: Maverick.[352]\\nThe Northrop F-20 Tigershark appears a number of times in Kaoru Shintani\\'s manga/animated franchise Area 88, as a personal unit of main character Shin Kazama.[353][354]\\nAlthough the F-20 never entered service, in Barrett Tillman\\'s 1991 novel Warriors, the Royal Saudi Air Force orders over a hundred of them. The RSAF assigns the fighter to select pilots who graduate from a localized version of Top Gun established by former USAF and USN pilots. The bigger plot of the novel involves the Saudi pilots joining a pan-Arab attack against Israel.[355]\\nThe F-22 Raptor is heavily featured in the 1998 Stephen Coonts novel Fortunes of War.[356] This novel sees Japan invade Russia with a fictional airplane they developed called the \"Zero\". While not wanting to directly come to the aid of the Russians, the US lends a squadron of F-22 Raptors to the Russian Air Force and hires American pilots to fly as sworn in members of the Russian military.\\nAfter appearing briefly in the 2003 Hulk film, the F-22 made its major Hollywood debut in the 2007 film Transformers and its 2009 sequel[357] as the form taken by the Decepticon character Starscream in addition to numerous USAF fighters that engaged during the initial and climactic battles. The film crew was allowed to film actual Raptors in flight, unlike previous computer-generated appearances, because of the military\\'s support of director Michael Bay. The Raptors were filmed at Edwards Air Force Base.[358]\\nThe real Raptor made its next big screen appearance in Iron Man, in which a Raptor call sign \"Whiplash 1\" lost its left wing during a mid-air collision with the Iron Man armor.[359]\\nToys released for Starscream were replica F-22 Raptor models. These models were reused for other characters in the line, like Thundercracker, Skywarp and Ramjet, that also turned into F-22 Raptors.[360]\\nAlthough the live-action 2007 film Transformers made Starscream the best-known Transformer that turns into an F-22, there were other F-22 Transformers before it. For instance the 1997 Machine Wars versions of Megatron and Megaplex transformed into F-22s.[361]\\nIn the 2013 film Olympus Has Fallen, computer animation was used to depict F-22 Raptors intercepting an armed AC-130 attacking Washington, D.C.; two F-22s are shot down before a third hits the AC-130 with a missile, causing it to crash.[227]\\nThe plane is the subject of a flight-simulation video game, F-22 Interceptor, which was released by Electronic Arts and Ingram Entertainment for the Sega Mega Drive console in 1991.[362]\\nThe F-22 Raptor, specifically the F-22A variant, is a major aircraft in the Ace Combat series, being prominently featured on the box art of several entries and being usable in a majority of the games in the series; one appearance is in Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown, which displays the F-22 on its box and used it in pre-release marketing.[363][364] The FB-22 also appears in several other games in the series, starting with Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War.[365]\\nThe first major film appearance of a representation of a Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II was 2006\\'s Superman Returns. During this film, a pair of F-35A fighters escorted the modified Boeing 777 mothership for an experimental NASA spaceplane. This visualization was a combination of an actual cockpit and CGI for the aircraft in flight.[193]\\nThe next major film appearance of an F-35 was in Live Free or Die Hard (released as Die Hard 4.0 outside North America) in 2007. The film used a combination of a full-scale model and CGI effects.[366]\\nThe Transformers character of the Autobot Breakaway and its redeco the Decepticon Thrust from the Revenge of the Fallen toy both disguise themselves as F-35s. Breakaway appears as a playable character in the 2009 Revenge of the Fallen video game.[367]\\nF-35s are depicted in the 2012 film The Avengers. The film was originally intended to include real F-35s, but the United States Department of Defense objected to the depiction of F-22s and F-35s as under the control of S.H.I.E.L.D., a covert, \"extra-governmental\" organization whose loyalties are unclear, so CGI aircraft were substituted instead.[368][369]\\nHal Jordan and Carol Ferris fly F-35s in a simulated dogfight against the UCAVs Carol\\'s company is trying to sell to the US Department of Defense in the 2011 film Green Lantern.[370]\\nA squadron of F-35s engages General Zod\\'s ship in the 2013 film Man of Steel.[16]\\nFor the 1955 biographical film The McConnell Story about ace Joseph C. McConnell, eight Republic F-84s of the 614th Fighter-Bomber Squadron donned dark blue paint with red stars to portray MiG-15s doing mock battle for the cameras with F-86 Sabres of the 366th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, both units based at Alexandria AFB, Louisiana. Air Defense Command headquarters notified its pilots in January 1955 that the mock MiGs would be operating over portions of the southwestern US.[371]\\nThe North American F-86 Sabre appears in the 1956 novel The Hunters by James Salter,[372] and the 1958 film of the same name, set in Korea, features North American F-86 Sabres.[373]\\nF-86s feature in the 1957 junior fiction novel Sabre Pilot by Stephen W. Meader about a youngster named Kirk Owen who enlists in the USAF and serves as a fighter pilot in the Korean War.[374]\\nF-86s were a feature in the 1958 film Jet Attack which was directed by Edward L. Cahn and starred John Agar and Audrey Totter. The film, also released as Jet Alert and Through Hell to Glory, was a drama set in the Korean War about a pair of pilots who parachute behind North Korean lines to rescue a captured scientist. The film, a low budget production, relied heavily on stock footage of F-86s for the aerial scenes.[375]\\nF-86s appear in the 1959 novel MiG Alley by Robert Eunson which portrays a pilot Captain Homer \\'Mac\\' McCullough who flies F-86s during the Korean War and is frustrated at being forbidden to engage enemy MiGs beyond the Yalu River.[376]\\nDesmond Bagley\\'s 1965 novel High Citadel features F-86 Sabres, which make up the frontline equipment of the air force of the fictional South American country in which the book is set. There are four squadrons of Sabres; two are loyal to the current corrupt government; one is secretly loyal to a reformist politician who is returning from exile to take over the country; and the fourth is secretly loyal to Communist forces who are attempting to kill the politician. The latter part of the novel features a dogfight between a Sabre flown by one of the main characters—a CIA agent and former Sabre pilot who fought in the Korean War—and aircraft of the Communist squadron.[288]\\nF-86F Sabres of the JASDF regularly feature in the Showa era of kaiju films produced by Toho, with the aircraft appearing most prominently during a sequence in Godzilla where two Sabres attack the titular monster after he leaves the devastated city of Tokyo.[377]\\nIn the 1981 dystopian film The Last Chase, retired pilot J.G. Williams (played by Burgess Meredith) and his F-86 Sabre play the antagonist in attempting to track down and destroy the protagonist Franklyn Hart (played by Lee Majors). After becoming sympathetic to Hart\\'s cause, Williams sacrifices himself in a kamikaze-style attack against a laser installation to protect Hart.[378]\\nA Sabre plays an important role in the 1999 film comedy Blast from the Past which stars Brendan Fraser and Christopher Walken. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Sabre pilot is forced to eject over a residential area in the US and the aircraft just happens to crash onto the house of an eccentric father who is sheltering with his family in a large underground bomb shelter he has constructed. Believing the crash to be the impact of a nuclear bomb, the family remain underground for 35 years.[379]\\nA pair of McDonnell F-101B Voodoos fly over the Russian submarine Спрут at the end of the 1966 comedy The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, directed by Norman Jewison. Although the film is set in New England, it was filmed on the West Coast and the fighters were from the 84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, based at the now-closed Hamilton Air Force Base, California.[380]\\nGen. Charles \"Chuck\" Yeager\\'s 10 December 1963 flying accident during a test flight in a modified rocket-boosted Lockheed NF-104A Starfighter was featured in The Right Stuff motion picture. The aircraft used for filming was a standard German Luftwaffe F-104G, flying with its wingtip fuel tanks removed; it otherwise lacked any of the NF-104A\\'s modifications, most visibly the rocket engine pod at the base of the vertical stabilizer.[381]\\nThe F-104 is featured heavily in the 1964 film The Starfighters, directed by Will Zens and starring future US Congressman Bob Dornan. The film later appeared on the Comedy Central series Mystery Science Theater 3000 as the subject of episode #612.[382]\\nAn F-104 Starfighter flown by Captain John Christopher, USAF, intercepts the USS Enterprise after the ship is thrown back in time by an encounter with a previously unmapped \"black star\" in first-season episode 1/19, \"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\", as the starship is struggling to climb out of Earth\\'s atmosphere over Omaha, Nebraska.[383]\\nFootage of an F-104 featured in the opening scenes of the science-fiction motion picture The Bamboo Saucer (1968), playing the role of an experimental jet called the \"X-109\" whose pilot Fred Norwood (John Ericson) encounters a UFO while carrying out a test flight.[384]\\nAn F-104 made regular appearances on the 1960s television sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. Leading man Major Anthony Nelson (Larry Hagman), a pilot in the US Air Force, was often to be seen landing and climbing out of the cockpit of an F-104A. That particular aircraft – 56-817 – later became part of the collection of the Pacific Aviation Museum on Ford Island, Oahu, Hawaii.[385]\\nCaptain Lockheed and the Starfighters is a 1974 satirical concept album by Robert Calvert and others, telling a fictionalized tale of the F-104G\\'s acquisition by and service with the German Air Force.[386] The album included tracks with names such as \"the Widowmaker\" and \"Catch a Falling Starfighter\".[387]\\nThe Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was the subject of the 1991 MicroProse game F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter 2.0[55] and the 1993 Sega Mega Drive-exclusive F-117 Night Storm.[388]\\nA former US Army Air Force Fairchild UC-61A Forwarder, painted in USAAF colours, makes a brief appearance to represent the Noorduyn UC-64A Norseman in which big band leader Glenn Miller disappeared in December 1944, in the 1954 Universal International Pictures film The Glenn Miller Story.[389]\\nThe same aircraft was also featured in a 1964 episode of Michael Bentine\\'s BBC TV comedy programme, It\\'s a Square World, about a shoestring airline with a staff of two. Filming took a day at Elstree Aerodrome, Herts. In 1965, it appeared in an episode of the ITV programme, The Moonraker.[389]\\nWhen the Fairchild Hiller FH-227D operating as Uruguayan Air Force (Fuerza Aérea Uruguaya) Flight 571 T-571 crashed in the Argentine Andes on 13 October 1972, it began a tale of amazing human survival for the 16 of the 45 on board who were rescued over two months later, after two passengers walked to civilization. The survivors\\' story was published in Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors, a critically acclaimed book by Piers Paul Read, in 1974. When the story was filmed in 1992 as Alive, directed by Frank Marshall, a similar FH-227 marked as the doomed aircraft was used for some shots, while Industrial Light and Magic depicted the crash using an eight-foot breakaway model, designed to shear at mid-fuselage.

The Soviet air defenses attempt to shoot down the aircraft as it tries to get out of Soviet airspace. The aircraft briefly flames out, but successfully recovers and narrowly escapes a missile trap by MiG-31 interceptors.[528]\\nAlthough already retired from service for around a decade at the time of the film\\'s release, the SR-71 Blackbird appears as the alt-mode of the character Jetfire, an over-the-hill Transformer near the end of his days, in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and its toy line.[529]\\nA Lockheed T-33, the trainer version of the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star, appeared in the 1955 science-fiction film This Island Earth. In one of the early scenes of the film, the hero scientist Cal (played by Rex Reason) is about to land his T-33 at the desert airfield near his government-owned laboratory when the aircraft becomes ensnared by some unknown alien force. The film achieved renewed fame when it was spoofed in the 1996 comedy Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie.[530]\\nA T-33 played the role of a Soviet \"Yak-12\" in the 1957 Cold War romantic/drama Jet Pilot which starred John Wayne and Janet Leigh and was directed by Howard Hughes.[531]\\nIn 2015, Steven Spielberg\\'s film Bridge of Spies recreated the 1960 events of a Lockheed U-2 piloted by Francis Gary Powers being shot down while on a reconnaissance mission over the Soviet Union.[532]\\nThe U-2 made an important appearance in the 2000 Beacon Pictures docudrama Thirteen Days as the aircraft that initially detected Soviet missiles being deployed in Cuba in October 1962, and was later shot down, killing pilot Maj. Rudolf Anderson, Jr. (played by Chip Esten),[533] the only combat casualty of the Cuban Missile Crisis.[534]\\nIn the 1980s television series Call to Glory, the U-2 was the \"main ride\" of U.S. Air Force Colonel Raynor Sarnac from the October 1962 Cuba Crisis to 1979.[535]\\nA Lockheed Vega DL-1B Special, one of only two that remain in flying condition, was used in the 1976 television miniseries Amelia Earhart, starring Susan Clark as the aviatrix.[536]\\nA Stinson Reliant stood in for Lockheed Vega DL-1 Special, G-ABGK, c/n 155, \"Puck\", race number 36,[537] in the 1991 Australian mini-series The Great Air Race, about the 1934 London to Melbourne MacRobertson Trophy Air Race.[266] It is also known as Half a World Away.[265]\\nThe 1927 William Wellman film Wings featured Martin MB-2s among many types depicting World War I aircraft.[263]\\nIn Michael Crichton\\'s Airframe, one of the characters uses the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 which involved a DC-10 to describe how a highly publicized accident can destroy a good airplane\\'s reputation because \"a media industry that has grown hostile and shallow with the ascendancy of television always jumps to the wrong conclusion.\"[538]\\nJames Bond fights the crew of the MBB Bo 105 helicopter as it flies over Mexico City\\'s Day of the Dead parade in the 2015 film Spectre[539]\\nTwo Messerschmitt Bf 108 Taifuns depicted Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters in the 1962 film The Longest Day,[540] and the type substituted for unavailable Luftwaffe fighters again in the 1964 film 633 Squadron.[541]\\n27 Spanish Hispano Aviación HA-1112 M1L \\'Buchon\\' single-engined fighters, Messerschmitt Bf 109s built under license in Spain, were used in the 1969 film Battle of Britain. The Buchons were altered to look more like correct Bf 109Es, adding mock machine guns and cannon, redundant tailplane struts, and removing the rounded wingtips.[542]\\nComputer-generated images of Bf 109Gs appear in the 2012 Second World War aerial film Red Tails directed by Anthony Hemingway and produced by Lucasfilm.[543]\\nA computer-generated Bf 109 also appears in the 2002 war film Hart\\'s War which starred Colin Farrell and Bruce Willis and was based on the 1999 novel of the same name by John Katzenbach.

In the film, the Luftwaffe raids \\'Pimpernel\\' Squadron\\'s airfield at Neethly. During the attack, Pilot Officer \\'Septic\\' Baird (John Gregson), although not yet an operational pilot, runs to a spare Hawker Hurricane fighter and takes off. He engages and shoots down a Bf-110 over the airfield and is later seen proudly inspecting the crashed aircraft although Baird is later reprimanded by his CO because during the battle, he carelessly left his radio stuck on \\'transmit\\', preventing other pilots from communicating.[545] The Messerschmitt used in the film was a captured Bf-110G-4 which was later scrapped after filming.[546]\\nThe American hard rock band Blue Öyster Cult portrayed a Messerschmitt Me 262A on the cover of their third album Secret Treaties (1974). The album also contains a song, \"Me 262\", written from the point of view of a Luftwaffe pilot on a bomber interception mission in April 1945.[547]\\nIn the 2000 alternate history novel Fox on the Rhine, by Douglas Niles and Michael Dobson, the Luftwaffe, under Adolf Galland\\'s command, prioritizes the development of the Me 262. A number of squadrons are used to maul a heavy bomber raid in concert with other, propeller-driven, fighters, but worker sabotage of the engines affects their operational performance.[548]\\nIn the second and last issue of the 2001 DC Vertigo miniseries Enemy Ace: War in Heaven, lead character Hans von Hammer leads a Luftwaffe flight against USAAF bomber formations with him piloting a scarlet red Me 262 that has no swastika tail insignia. Seeing the hopelessness of the war, he and his men later destroy the remaining 262s in their control before surrendering to a US Army unit.[549]\\nAs was common in the 1950s, \"MiGs\" (presumably MiG−15s, as the story is set in Korea) appear in the 1956 novel The Hunters by James Salter about USAF fighter pilots.[372] As was common in the 1950s, the MiGs are portrayed by Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks in the 1958 film The Hunters[373]\\nMiGs were also played on screen by the F-5 Tiger II in 1986\\'s Top Gun[315][316] and the 1998 JAG episode 3.24.[550]\\nMiGs feature in the 2007 novel Ascent by UK author Jed Mercurio, a fictional work about a Soviet pilot Yefgeni Yeremin covertly flying MiGs during the Korean War.[551] The book was later adapted into a graphic novel in 2011, illustrated by Wesley Robins.[552]\\nThe Indian (Hindi) films Silsila (1981), Border and Rang De Basanti (2006) depicted the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21.[553]\\nThe Mikoyan MiG-29 is the alternate form of the figure Dreadwing as well as its redecos Overcast and Fearswoop from the 2007 and 2009 Transformers film toy lines.[554]\\nA Mil Mi-17 is used in the 2001 film Behind Enemy Lines as a NATO combat search and rescue (CSAR) helicopter that makes an attempt to rescue a downed airman.[555]\\nAt the beginning of the 2002 film Die Another Day, a Mil Mi-8T is commandeered by James Bond, to infiltrate the antagonists\\' base.[556]\\nThe aircraft also appeared in the 2006 film Blood Diamond, directed by Edward Zwick; it was used by the protagonist to reach a refugee camp.[555]\\nAn Mil Mi-8 helicopter features in a major sequence in the 2019 Netflix film Triple Frontier directed by J C Chandor and starring Ben Affleck.[557]\\nMi-8s appear in the 2019 HBO mini-series Chernobyl.[558] Mi-8s were among the Soviet helicopters used to firefight and monitor the exploded reactor in 1986.[559] In the series, helicopters are seen dropping sand-bags onto the fire and one helicopter is destroyed in a crash. The series portrays the incident as taking place shortly after the initial explosion at the reactor but in reality, the crash occurred some weeks later.[560]\\nA Mil Mi-24 helicopter appears in the 1997 film Air Force One. The aircraft is used to retrieve a Russian prisoner in exchange for the US President, who is being held captive.[148]\\nIt is featured numerous times in the Metal Gear video game series, starting from the 1987 MSX original.[561] Its appearance as a boss battle in the 1998 game Metal Gear Solid is probably the most famous instance.[562][563][564][565][566][567]\\nThe helicopter is used extensively in the 2005 film The 9th Company, which fictionally depicts the Battle for Hill 3234 where Soviet Army paratroopers defend their post against Mujahideen fighters. It was especially employed to eliminate the Mujahideen\\'s last wave of attack in the film\\'s climactic battle.[503]\\nIn the 2006 film Blood Diamond, a Mi-24 is employed to attack a rebel village.[555]\\nThe 2007 film Charlie Wilson\\'s War portrays the Mi-24 as used in the Soviet–Afghan War.

Grounded for investigation, the problem was traced to shoddy workmanship at the Mecklenburg factory where defective wood spars, water damage to glued parts, and pins carelessly splintering the members instead of securing them were discovered. Upon return to service two months later, the design was renamed the Fokker D.VIII in an effort to avoid the type\\'s reputation as a killer.[575][576]\\nNaval Aircraft Factory N3N Canarys were shown in the 1941 Warner Bros. film Dive Bomber.[304]\\nNakajima Ki-27s, lifted from Japanese film, appeared in the 1942 Republic film Flying Tigers.[230]\\nA replica of a Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa appeared in the 2007 Japanese motion picture For Those We Love,[577] a drama about WW2 Kamikaze pilots.[578]\\nThe Nieuport 17 was one of the main aircraft featured in the 2006 film Flyboys.[579][580]\\nAn authentic Nieuport 28 was provided and flown by Frank Tallman, a Hollywood film pilot, for The Twilight Zone episode \"The Last Flight\" in which a World War I Royal Flying Corps pilot is transported in time in a cloud to the 1960s.

Many details about the aircraft looks, performance and procedures are given throughout the book, and as almost the entirety of the book is set inside Sunderlands, the warplane practically becomes a character. Other aircraft, both from Allied and German origin, are also featured and mentioned.[641][642]\\nA Short Sunderland was the setting for much of the 1980 novel The Flying Porcupine by Richard Haligon. The novel takes its title from a nickname reputedly given to the Sunderland by German pilots thanks to its defensive armament of as many as 16 machine guns.[643]\\nCIA officer Jack Ryan (played by Alec Baldwin) is flown from an aircraft carrier to the submarine USS\\xa0Dallas in a Sikorsky SH-3H Sea King in the 1990 film Hunt for Red October, based on the Tom Clancy\\'s novel of the same title.[153]\\nAt the end of the successful rescue mission for Apollo 13, two SH-3 Sea Kings, historically painted as Helos 66 and 406, retrieve the astronauts from their spacecraft after splashdown in the 1995 Ron Howard film.[148]\\nThe 1954 film The Bridges at Toko-Ri, based on the 1953 James A.

Production designer Jeff Mann stated \"the Pave Low looks butch\\xa0... the size made it the logical choice.\"[653] Toys for Blackout were MH-53 replicas, which were reused for the characters of Evac, Spinister and Whirl.[654]\\nThe heavier CH-53E Super Stallion is the alternate form for the Decepticon Grindor in the 2009 film Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.[655]\\nThe Sikorsky MH-53 appears in the 2009 video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, referred to simply as the \"Pave Low\".[656]\\nIn the 1996 film Independence Day a Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane is fitted with an array of flashing lights to communicate with an alien spaceship.[56]\\nA Skycrane also appears in the 2001 film Swordfish, near the climactic ending in which it has a bus full of hostages slung loaded underneath, and is flying through downtown Los Angeles.[657]\\nIn the 1994 film Clear and Present Danger a pair of MH-60K Black Hawks are used to insert a special ops team, into a Colombian jungle.[154]\\nBlack Hawks were also featured in the 1997 film Air Force One, having been rented from the US military.[184]\\nThe Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk was the title aircraft in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down.[658] For this film too the film makers rented the aircraft, paying the US Department of Defense about $3 million to ship eight helicopters and about 100 crew members to the film location in Morocco.[185]\\nIn the 2003 film Tears of the Sun three SH-60 Seahawk helicopters bring evacuated US embassy staff and their SEAL team rescuers from Nigeria to the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman. Two SH-60 Seahawk helicopters are used to retrieve a SEAL team and refugees in Nigeria.[212]\\nIgor Sikorsky\\'s Sikorsky S-29-A, previously owned by Roscoe Turner, doubled for a Gotha bomber in Howard Hughes\\' 1930 aerial epic Hell\\'s Angels.[659] It was destroyed during filming. At the time of the aircraft\\'s demise it had flown 500,000 miles.[660]\\nReplicas of the Sikorsky S-38 were used in the filming of the 2004 Martin Scorsese biopic of Howard Hughes, The Aviator.[661][662]\\nWhen MGM produced the 1959 film The Gallant Hours, based on the life of US Navy Admiral William \"Bull\" Halsey, the studio rented a Sikorsky VS-44A, N41881, named \"Mother Goose\", from Catalina Air Lines, Inc., and painted it in wartime camouflage to depict a secret flight that Halsey had made to the South Pacific in a Consolidated PB2Y-1 Coronado. Although the studio had promised to repaint the flying boat after the production, this did not happen, and the airline had to restore the civilian livery itself.[663]\\nThe First World War Sopwith Camel fighter features prominently in the Biggles stories of W. E. Johns such as the collections: The Camels Are Coming (1932),[664] and Biggles of the Camel Squadron (1934).[665]\\nThe 1934 novel Winged Victory by Victor M.

The replica, built in 1992, was purchased from a private museum in Alabama.[669]\\nThe fictional RFC squadron in Derek Robinson\\'s 1999 First World War novel Hornet\\'s Sting flies the Sopwith Pup.[206]\\nThe Transformers Combaticon named Blast Off, the Autobot Sky Lynx, and triple-changer Astrotrain all disguise themselves as Space Shuttle orbiters.[670]\\nIn the 1979 James Bond film Moonraker the film opens with the disappearance during a routine transfer flight, on the back of a Boing 747, of the eponymous space shuttle, built and operated by the Drax Corporation.[671]\\nIn Payne Harrison\\'s 1990 novel Storming Intrepid, the shuttle Intrepid – one of four new shuttles built by the US government – is hijacked by its mission commander, who is a Russian agent. The plot revolves around American efforts to prevent the agent from landing the shuttle in the USSR with its advanced SDI system intact.[528]\\nIn the 2000 film Space Cowboys, four retired astronauts launch into space aboard the shuttle Daedalus to repair a crippled Russian satellite.[671]\\nIn Jon Amiel\\'s 2003 film The Core, space shuttle Endeavour is sent off course by a disruption in the Earth\\'s magnetic field, forcing it to land in the concrete-lined channel of the Los Angeles River.[671]\\nIn the 2013 film Gravity, space shuttle Explorer is destroyed by an out of control satellite in the early portion of the film.[672]\\nThe 1927 William Wellman film Wings featured a SPAD S.VII among many types depicting World War I aircraft.[263]\\nRace Bannon, flying a SPAD S.XIII, fights a dogfight with a Fokker D.VII, flown by Baron Heinrich von Frohleich in Episode 10 of Jonny Quest, \"Shadow of the Condor\", first aired 20 November 1964.[404]\\nThe 1976 film Aces High uses several modified Stampe SV.4 aircraft made to look like Royal Flying Corps Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 aircraft. These were prepared by Bianchi Aviation Film Services and flown by well-known pilots including Neil Williams.[673]\\nA Standard J-1 appeared in the 1923 film The Eleventh Hour which starred Alan Hale Sr. During the film, a J-1 attacks a submarine on the surface but the aircraft is hit by return fire from the vessel and it explodes in mid-air. To film the scene, stunt pilot Dick Kerwood was required to fly over the submarine (loaned by the US Navy) in San Diego Bay and, at about 3,000 feet, parachute out of his plane after setting the timer to explosives which would detonate ten seconds later. However the timer proved faulty and the aircraft exploded before Kerwood could bale out. He was seriously concussed but otherwise escaped injury and he managed to open his chute in time.[674]\\nA Stearman C3R featured in the 1958 film No Place to Land directed by Albert C. Gannaway and starring John Ireland. The film was a drama about crop-duster pilots in post-war rural California competing with each other for work.[675]\\nA static replica of a Stinson Model A was featured in the 1988 Australian TV-film The Riddle of the Stinson which starred Jack Thompson. The film was a dramatisation of the true-life crash of an Australian Airlines Stinson in Queensland in 1937 which claimed the lives of 5 men and the subsequent rescue of two survivors ten days later by local Bernard O\\'Reilly who treked into the rainforest and found the crash-site.[676][677]\\nAlong with the Hawker Hurricane,[453] the Supermarine Spitfire fighter is very strongly linked to the Battle of Britain in summer 1940, where the Royal Air Force fought the German Luftwaffe over the skies of Britain for air superiority.[452] As such it has been featured in many works of fiction related to the Battle of Britain.\\nThe 1951 film Malta Story is about Spitfires and their pilots defending Malta in 1942.[678]\\nA Spitfire IXc was one of at least two used in the production of the 1962 World War II epic film The Longest Day. The same aircraft also appeared in Von Ryan\\'s Express (1965), Night of the Generals (1967), and Battle of Britain (1969).[679][680]\\nThe Spitfire was a central part of the 1969 Guy Hamilton-directed film Battle of Britain, a fictionalized account of the real Battle of Britain that one critic called \"the definitive depiction of war in the air\".[456] The film led to an increase in the popularity of the aircraft among collectors of warbirds. According to one property dealer the appearance \"did for Spitfires what the James Bond films did for the Aston Martin.\"[681] Producers secured 35 Spitfires for use in the film.[456]\\nThe Spitfire was also the main aircraft used in the 1988 miniseries Piece of Cake. The series was based on a novel by the same name. Pilots in the novel flew the Hawker Hurricane, but the lack of airworthy Hurricanes forced the producers to change aircraft types, using five privately owned airworthy Spitfires and a collection of static and taxiing replicas.[682]\\nReal-life World War II RAF ace Douglas Bader was portrayed as a night-flying Spitfire pilot during The Blitz in the animated Disney series Gargoyles second-season episode \"M.I.A\", and was saved from losing his life in air combat by Goliath and by Griff, a British gargoyle of the London Clan.[683]\\nThe 2001 Czech film Dark Blue World, a World War II drama about Czech pilots who flew with the Royal Air Force directed by Jan Svěrák, featured Spitfires. The vintage Spitfires cost the film-makers US$7,500 an hour to use. The aerial sequences were a combination of live aerial footage, CGI and out-takes from the 1969 film The Battle of Britain.[684]\\nSpitfires starred in the 2006 seven-minute short film/commercial Pilots produced by the Swiss-German watch manufacturer IWC Schaffhausen to promote its Big Pilot\\'s Watch Collection. John Malkovich featured in the film.[685]\\nThe second prototype Supermarine Swift appeared as the \"Prometheus\" in the 1952 film The Sound Barrier.[99][686]\\nDouglas TBDs feature in the 2019 film Midway directed by Roland Emmerich. To portray the aircraft, the producers recreated TBDs digitally[636] and also constructed a full-scale static replica which, after filming was completed, was donated to the USS Midway Museum in San Diego.[687] In the film, TBDs are depicted as simultaneously carrying a pair of 500-pound bombs on wing racks in addition to a torpedo, a scene which would not have happened in reality, as under-powered TBDs struggled enough with the weight of just a torpedo.[636]\\nA Tupolev Tu-154B was in the centre of the plot of the 1979 Soviet film Air Crew. The film is a recognized classic in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.[688]\\nThe UFM Easy Riser was one of two ultralight aircraft that lead the Canada geese south in the 1996 film Fly Away Home. The film was a highly fictionalized account based on Bill Lishman\\'s autobiography and work with Operation Migration, but both Lishman\\'s real-life migratory experiments teaching birds to migrate and the film used the Easy Riser, due to its low cruising speed, which allowed the birds to pace the aircraft in flight.[689][690]\\nA replica Vickers FB5 was constructed to appear in the 1986 film Sky Bandits (also released under the title Gunbus) which was about a pair of cowboys who flee the US to escape prison for a bank robbery and end up serving in the RFC during the Great War. The replica, built as a taxiing prop for the film, is currently housed at Sywell Aerodrome in the UK.[691]\\nThe Vickers Wellington features in the 1941 film Target for Tonight.[692]\\nNevil Shute\\'s romance Pastoral is a wartime story of a pilot and his crew of a Wellington bomber based at a fictional RAF station called \"Hartley Magna\".[693][694]\\nA Vickers Wellington features in the 1961 comedy film Very Important Person (released in the US as A Coming Out Party). In the film, the central character, a military scientist named Sir Ernest Pease (James Robertson Justice) is taken over Germany during WW2 to test a top-secret apparatus. However the Wellington is hit by anti-aircraft fire and Pease is sucked out through a hole in the fuselage, parachuting into enemy territory and ending up in a POW camp.[695]\\nThe 1968 Czechoslovak film Nebeští jezdci (Sky Riders) about Czechoslovak airmen in RAF Bomber Command featured a Vickers Wellington.[696] It was depicted by a taxiing replica based on an extensively modified Lisunov Li-2. Flight sequences were shot with large scale replicas and the film also incorporated wartime stock footage, including scenes from Target for Tonight.[697]\\nA haunted Vickers Wellington is the subject of Robert Westall\\'s macabre, and critically appreciated, 1982 short story Blackham\\'s Wimpy.[698]\\nIrish graphic novelist Garth Ennis chose the Wellington to be the aircraft flown by the Australian crew of RAF Bomber Command in his 2010 graphic novel Happy Valley, set in 1942 during the early phase of the night bombing offensive and one of his Battlefields series.[699]\\nTwo Bell-Boeing CV-22 Ospreys (of only three in the USAF inventory at the time)[700] were filmed in flight at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, in May 2006 for the 2007 Transformers film.[701][702] This would inspire a host of Transformers toys and characters based on the Osprey including the Decepticons Incinerator and Ruination as well as the Autobots Springer and Blades.[703]\\nAt least seven Waco 10 biplanes were employed in the production of the 1928 film Lilac Time, a romantic drama about a British pilot in the Royal Flying Corps in WW1. The film was directed by George Fitzmaurice and starred Gary Cooper (being a silent film, Cooper did not have to fake a British accent). Wacos played the role of generic RFC planes and three were deliberately crashed during filming of the aerial combat scenes. Dick Grace, only just recovered from injuries he sustained while working on the film Wings the previous year, was the stunt pilot for two of the crash-landing scenes.[704]\\nDeveloped in the 1960s by former RAF Wing Commander Ken Wallis, the Wallis WA-116 Agile was an improved, more stable autogyro design. Following a prototype, five WA-116s were built by Beagle Aircraft at Shoreham, three of which were for evaluation by the British Army Air Corps.[705] In 1966, one of the Beagle-built WA-116s, registered G-ARZB, was modified for use in the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice, dubbed \"Little Nellie\" and flown by Wallis, doubling for Sean Connery\\'s 007.[706]\\nThe Wright brothers\\' Wright Flyer is featured in the Season Seven episode of The Simpsons \"Sideshow Bob\\'s Last Gleaming\". In the episode, first aired 26 November 1995, Sideshow Bob steals the Flyer, which is on loan from the Smithsonian Institution, while it is on display at an airshow. He then flies it into a shack from which Krusty the Clown is making a television broadcast to put Krusty off the air; however, instead of demolishing the building the frail Flyer merely bounces off the wall undamaged.[707]\\nSeveral replicas of the Wright Model B were constructed for the filming of the 1978 telemovie The Winds of Kitty Hawk. One of the replicas is now owned and preserved by Wright B Flyers Inc. based in Dayton, Ohio.[708]\\nThe Martin XB-51 depicted the fictional Gilbert XF-120 in the 1956 film Toward the Unknown, starring William Holden as a test pilot.[709] On 25 March 1956, the first XB-51 prototype, 46-0685, crashed in sand dunes near Biggs Air Force Base, El Paso, Texas, killing both crew, while staging to Eglin AFB, Florida, for filming of scenes for the motion picture.[710]\\nA Zeppelin appears in the 1929 Fox Corporation film The Sky Hawk which was directed by John G. Blystone. The film portrayed an aristocratic Englishman Jack Bardell (played by John Garrick) who joins the Royal Flying Corps during the Great War. In the film, Bardell is badly injured in a crash in France which leaves him with only partial use of his legs. The unclear circumstances surrounding the crash lead him to suffer accusations of cowardice. Determined to reclaim his honour, Bardell secretly rebuilds a derelict aircraft and attaches special stirrups to the rudder pedals so he is able to fly it. He takes off on an un-authorised patrol over London and destroys a Zeppelin raider, restoring his reputation in the process.[711]\\nA German Zeppelin is shot down in the 1930 Howard Hughes film Hell\\'s Angels.[712]\\nA bombing raid by a Zeppelin comprises a major plot point in the Elsie McCutcheon novel Summer of the Zeppelin.[713]\\nIn the 2017 film, Wonder Woman, a Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI is loaded with 4,500 pounds of bombs filled with poisonous gas intended for London. Steve Trevor destroys it by detonating the payload mid flight, sacrificing himself.[714]\\n'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"doc = nlp(TEXT)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-14T06:48:53.226937Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-14T06:48:53.227802Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.023233Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-14T06:48:53.227750Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.022307Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for sent in doc._.textrank.summary(limit_sentences = 2):\n    print(sent)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.024526Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.024772Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.041813Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.024741Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.041110Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\nAircraft in fiction covers various real-world aircraft that have made significant appearances in fiction over the decades, including in books, films, toys, TV programs, video games, and other media.\nIn the United States, the use or denial of use of current military aircraft in films is determined by the US military itself.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for sent in doc._.textrank.summary(limit_phrases = 4, limit_sentences = 20):\n    print(sent)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.043557Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.044431Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.076775Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.044378Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.076084Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\nAircraft in fiction covers various real-world aircraft that have made significant appearances in fiction over the decades, including in books, films, toys, TV programs, video games, and other media.\nIn the United States, the use or denial of use of current military aircraft in films is determined by the US military itself.\nThe armed services review all requests for the use of aircraft, by examining the scripts to ensure that aircraft will only be used in films that show the US military in a positive light.\nBecause alternatives to using real military aircraft can be expensive, films that do not get US military approval often do not get financed or made.\nThe bomber also made appearances in films Iron Man 2, Captain Marvel, and Rampage.[84]\nBoeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the 132nd Bomb Squadron, 9th Bomb Group from March Field, California, (\"Land of the Flying Fortress\") were featured in the 1941 Paramount Pictures film I Wanted Wings, based on the novel of the same title by 1st Lt.

Henry Arnold doing the stunt flying.\n\"Arnold, who picked up 'a few extra bucks' for his services, became so excited about movies that he almost quit the Army to become an actor.\n\"[2]\nThe years between World War I and World War II saw extensive use of the new technology, aircraft, in the new medium, film.[3]\nIn the early 1920s Hollywood studios made dozens of now-obscure \"aerial Westerns\" with leads such as Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson, where the role of the horse was taken by aircraft, or used aircraft as nothing more than vehicles for stunts to excite audiences.[4] In 1926 the first \"proper\" aviation film was made; Wings is a story of two pilots who sign up to fly and fight in The Great War.[5] Made with the co-operation of the United States' then-Department of War (a relationship that continues to this day), it used front-line military aircraft of the day such as the Thomas-Morse MB-3 and Boeing PW-9, flown by military pilots.[6][7] Future US Air Force Generals Hap Arnold and Hoyt Vandenberg were among the military officers involved with the production, Arnold as a technical consultant and Vandenberg as one of the pilots.[8]\nWings was a box-office hit when it achieved general release in 1929 and went on to win the award for Best Production at the first Academy Awards.[9][10]\nIn Fascist Italy in the 1930s, aviation-themed films were used as propaganda tools to complement the massed flights led by Italo Balbo in promoting the regime domestically and abroad.[11] One such film was the most successful Italian film of the pre-World War II era; Luciano Serra pilota (Luciano Serra, Pilot) was inextricably linked to the Fascist government via Mussolini's son Vittorio, who was the driving force behind the film's production.[12] The film, set between 1921 and the Italo-Abyssinian War, was used to compare the allegedly moribund state of aviation in pre-Fascist Italy with the purported power of the Regia Aeronautica and Italian aviation in general in the 1930s.[13]\nHowever, by the time that Luciano Serra pilota was shown at the 1938 Venice Film Festival, the link between aviation and Fascism had already been firmly established in the minds of the Italian people through widespread depictions of aircraft in a variety of media.[12] For example, there was an entire branch of the Futurist Art movement devoted to aviation, known as Aeropittura (\"Aeropainting\").[14] While many of the Aeropittura works were devoted to flight rather than aircraft per se, some did celebrate Italian aviation exploits, such as Alfredo Ambrosi's Il volo su Vienna (The Flight over Vienna) which depicted in Futurist style the World War I exploit of Gabriele d'Annunzio; although the city of Vienna is shown in abstract in accordance with the aims of Aeropittura – namely to show the dynamism and excitement of flight – the Ansaldo SVA aircraft are very carefully and accurately rendered.[14][15]\n\n\nSean McElwee, writing for Salon.com, concluded of this problem,\"This is a prima facie case for de facto censorship ...\nIf the government wants to allow its equipment to be used by studios, it needs to grant access to anyone who wants to use it – that is the meaning of pluralism.\nThe Pentagon fears that some of the movies may hurt the military's reputation and recruiting efforts.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"phrases_and_ranks = [ \n    (phrase.chunks[0], phrase.rank) for phrase in doc._.phrases\n]\nphrases_and_ranks[:10]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.077689Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.078010Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.090114Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.077983Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-14T06:49:02.089409Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"execution_count":16,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"[(film, 0.07849124881426392),\n (films, 0.07849124881426392),\n (action film, 0.07601825480269878),\n (Japanese film, 0.07552330028589772),\n (several films, 0.07542029154893737),\n (Transformers film, 0.07479941936509621),\n (training film, 0.07462385923665044),\n (kaiju films, 0.07414720716028544),\n (several Hollywood films, 0.06961156415171894),\n (used aircraft, 0.05889162400769933)]"},"metadata":{}}]}]}
